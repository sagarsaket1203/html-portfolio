<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Sagar Kumar, a passionate third-year B.Tech student at KIIT University. My studies ignite a fire in me, constantly pushing me to learn and grow. When I'm not tackling academic challenges, you'll find me on the cricket pitch, relishing the thrill of the game. Cricket isn't just a sport; it's a chance to strategize, collaborate, and test my skills.</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom and the field, I have a strong case of wanderlust. I crave exploring new places, immersing myself in different cultures, and collecting experiences that broaden my perspective. Traveling allows me to see the world through a fresh lens, and I'm always on the lookout for my next adventure.</p>
